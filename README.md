[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/probot/stale.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Inspired by @parkr's [auto-reply](https://github.com/parkr/auto-reply#optional-mark-and-sweep-stale-issues) bot that runs @jekyllbot.

## Usage

1. **[Configure the GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/stale)**
2. Create `.github/stale.yml` based on the following template
3. It will start scanning for stale issues and/or pull requests within an hour.

A `.github/stale.yml` file is required to enable the plugin. The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:

```yml
# Configuration for probot-stale - https://github.com/probot/stale

# Number of days of inactivity before an Issue or Pull Request becomes stale
daysUntilStale: 60
# Number of days of inactivity before a stale Issue or Pull Request is closed.
# Set to false to disable. If disabled, issues still need to be closed manually, but will remain marked as stale.
daysUntilClose: 7
# Issues or Pull Requests with these labels will never be considered stale. Set to `[]` to disable
exemptLabels:
  - pinned
  - security
  - "[Status] Maybe Later"
# Set to true to ignore issues in a project (defaults to false)
exemptProjects: false
# Set to true to ignore issues in a milestone (defaults to false)
exemptMilestones: false
# Label to use when marking as stale
staleLabel: wontfix
# Comment to post when marking as stale. Set to `false` to disable
markComment: >
  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
  for your contributions.
# Comment to post when removing the stale label. Set to `false` to disable
unmarkComment: false
# Comment to post when closing a stale Issue or Pull Request. Set to `false` to disable
closeComment: false
# Limit the number of actions per hour, from 1-30. Default is 30
limitPerRun: 30
# Limit to only `issues` or `pulls`
# only: issues
#
# Optionally, specify configuration settings that are specific to just 'issues' or 'pulls':
# pulls:
#   daysUntilStale: 30
#   markComment: >
#     This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
#     recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
#     for your contributions.
# issues:
#   exemptLabels:
#     - confirmed
```

## How are issues and pull requests considered stale?

The app uses GitHub's [updated](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/#search-based-on-when-an-issue-or-pull-request-was-created-or-last-updated) search qualifier to determine staleness. Any change to an issues and pull request is considered an update, including comments, changing labels, applying or removing milestones,  or pushing commits.

An easy way to check and see which issues or pull requests will initially be marked as stale is to add the `updated` search qualifier to either the issue or pull request page filter for your repository: `updated:<2017-07-01`. Adjust the date to be 60 days ago (or whatever you set for `daysUntilStale`) to see which issues or pull requests will be marked.

## Why did only some issues and pull requests get marked stale?

To avoid triggering abuse prevention mechanisms on GitHub, only 30 issues and pull requests will be marked or closed per hour. If your repository has more than that, it will just take a few hours or days to mark them all.

## Deployment

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this plugin.
